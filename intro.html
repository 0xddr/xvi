Although propagandist (it was ordered by Sigismund I the Old, King of Poland), it shows Polish-Lithuanian army in one of the most interesting periods in its history. At that time Polish (and Lithuanian, as we were close allies) army was mixture of influences from East and West, which led to the creation of an unique tactic and diverse military force.</p> <p>The <strong>idea</strong> is to create: paint and probably sculpt 28mm wargame, early 16th century Polish miniature army. I want to put pressure on the historical accuracy, as sources are relatively easy to find, and make a research an integral part of the project. To make all units look consistent I narrow time of interest to the period between years 1512 and 1531: dates of two great Polish victories: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Orsha">Orsha</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Obertyn">Obertyn</a>.</p> <p>What is the <strong>plan</strong>? Right now I have bunch of late medieval Perry miniatures, both infantry and cavalry: <a href="https://www.perry-miniatures.com/product_info.php?cPath=22_62&amp;products_id=2713">Men-at-arms</a>, <a href="https://www.perry-miniatures.com/product_info.php?cPath=22_62&amp;products_id=2490">Mercenaries</a> and <a href="https://www.perry-miniatures.com/product_info.php?cPath=22_62&amp;products_id=2471">Wars of the Roses Infantry</a>. The heavy cavalry is almost ready to use straight away. At the time, it didn’t differ much from its Western European counterparts. Infantry by contrast, kept its supportive role and was organized and armed differently in the West. Perrys are good bases, but require some work to make it look more Polish. I am still looking for miniatures representing other units: early hussars (winged lancers), light cavalry (pl. <em>chorągwie strzelcze</em>) and artillery. I will use this army mostly in fantasy wargaming (KoW2, 9th Age), so in the meantime I am also going to look for alternatives for fantasy units.</p> <p>I try to keep you posted!</p> </div> </article> </main> <!-- Pagination links --> </div> <!-- Footer --> <footer><span>@2015 - Emerald</span></footer> <!-- Script --> <script src="/xvi/js/main.js"></script> <!-- Google Analytics --> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-69533112-1', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> </div> </body> </html>
