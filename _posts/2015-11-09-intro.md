title: Here I start
---

I am staring this blog mostly to keep myself motivated with my recent wargaming project: 28mm early 16th century Polish army.

The **inspiration** to start was this painting of Battle of Orsha:
![Battle of Orsha by Krell]({{ site.images_dir}}Krell_Battle_of_Orsha_01.jpg)

It was painted a few years after battle, but still amaze with precision and attention to details. Although propagandist (it was ordered by Sigismund I the Old, King of Poland), it shows Polish-Lithuanian army in one of the most interesting periods in its history. At that time Polish (and Lithuanian, as we were close allies) army was mixture of influences from East and West, which led to creation of unique tactic and diverse military force. 

The **idea** is to create: paint and probably sculpt 28mm wargame, early 16th century Polish army. I want to put pressure on the historical accuracy, as sources are relatively easy to find, and make a research an integral part of the project. To make all units look consistent I narrow time of interest to the period between years 1512 and 1531: dates of two great victories: [Orsha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Orsha) and [Obertyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Obertyn). 

What is the **plan**? Right now I have bunch of late medieval Perry miniatures, both infantry and cavalry. The heavy cavalry is almost ready to use straight away. At the time, it didn't differ much from its Western European counterparts. Infantry by contrast to Western Europe, kept its supportive role and was organized and armed differently. Perrys are good bases, but require some work to make it look more Polish. 

I try to keep you posted!
